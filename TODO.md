## üìù **Development Guidelines for Future Sessions**

### **For Claude AI Assistants:**

1. **Always Update This File**: When completing any task, update the corresponding checkbox in this TODO.md file
2. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Maintain consistency with current code architecture and patterns
3. **Type Safety First**: Ensure all new code maintains TypeScript type safety
4. **Test Before Deploy**: Always run `npm run types` and `composer test` before marking tasks complete
5. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation when adding new features

### **Code Standards:**
- Follow existing Laravel and React conventions
- Use existing UI components from `resources/js/components/ui/`
- Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Keep database relationships properly defined
- Use Inertia.js for server-client communication

### **Priority Order:**
1. Complete Phase 3 interactive features first
2. Focus on user-facing functionality before admin features
3. Implement security measures early
4. Performance optimization comes after feature completion
